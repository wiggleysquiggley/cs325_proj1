Beautiful kitchen aid. Like brand new !

Item is nice. Looks new.

Works like a charm n love the color

Nice machine works well great color

Looks new and works perfectly. Thank you

Works great and comes with 3 attachment. Whisk, mixer, and dough hook. Would buy again

Looks as good as new, come with the three mixing attachments but does not include the cover. Which was shown in pictures but still looks better in person cant wait to try it out!

Look and works like its brand new! Received quickly

It‚Äôs beautiful and I love it. I have used it twice and works great

Looks and works like it‚Äôs brand new!

Great product and price lightning fast shipping. A+++++ seller.

Excellent condition for a refurbished unit. No complaints

Item was in perfect shape. Seller was great.

Received my item in a timely matter and in great condition! Very happy with my purchase.

Like new; beautiful item with a fast, strong motor. I look forward to another 15 years of service from this machine.

The mixer seems to be fine. But the box was all beat up and covered in gravel dust. The styrofoam that holding the mixer was busted. FedEx is a poor delivery service.

Love this mixer I have been wanting one for a long time and my regret is I didn't get this sooner. I love using it and it has made baking so much easier!!!

Great item and works.

Life changer. I'm so glad this was available refurbished for a reasonable price.

Excellent mixer. Fast shipping. Excellent price

Products Be, prendre Level and Is is Expected, I‚Äôm Yury Ust For Everything is good Ôøº

Very nice. Looks brand new. Thank you!!!

best price around!! came super quick!! all perfect just wonderful!! love it! thanks so very much!!

I'm so happy to have a refurbished one - in red! - for a very reasonable price. It arrived earlier than the estimate by a few days.

Got to finally use our mixed yesterday and it worked beautifully

Nice unit. Arrived in one week. Came in original box. Thanks.

Fast shipping. Arrived in great condition. Will use this seller agai!

Item as described, and works as expected. Quickly shipped and no issues. Would recommend.

Looks perfect! It was missing the scrapper whisk (#13) though. I'll need to order one from Amazon. Shipping took the full time allotted and arrived in a clean new Kitchenaid box with original instructions. I would definitely do business with them again despite the scraper whisk. For the huge savings in the mixer, buying the scraper whisk isn't a big deal.

nice machine, great price

As described! The mixer looks and works great! Thank you!

Really easy to use and sturdy

Arrived today. It is just the color I wanted! This seller was very professional and easy to work with. I can‚Äôt wait to start baking! I highly recommend this seller!

Item as promised. Perfect condition and just like factory new. Good deal!

The mixer is beautiful! I fortunately we have not used it yet!

the fed ex driver left it out in the open in the middle of a thunderstorm, instead of putting under the porch roof not 4ft from where he actually left it. everything i received is soaking wet and im going to let it dry thoroughly before plugging it in and seeing if it‚Äôs damaged due to his negligence and laziness

Gorgeous mixer, received on time in great condition. I am loving this product and would buy from this seller again.

Excellent, it even came a day earlier. Mixer runs great

Great product fast shipping A +++ seller Great price.

Great quality! Great seller! Thank you!

Excellent Condition! Great deal for refurbished machine!

I have wanted a stand mixer for years and now I have one! Decent price and looks very nice.

the item came to me very fast, I just had a hard time stopping the order because I found the item in a store and the color was not the same as the photo. KitchenAid is always fast and helpful with returns, I just felt it could have been cancelled and save time, if they were as fast with eBay sales as well.

Arrived a day early, item as described, I have used it a few times and so far so good.

Easy way to go direct looks great arrived on time!

Arrived in perfect condition! Super fast shipping, and an amazing seller!

Love the red

A ok

The mixer survived FedEx. It must have had a harrowing experience. The box in which it arrived looked as though it had been beaten by a pack of loan sharks and dragged behind the truck. All the packing material inside was crushed with all the pieces were loose inside the box.

Just as described!

Excellent. perfect.

Took a while to get in. No response from seller as to when item would be shipped. Item works great. Theircustomers service needs works.

Great price for a great mixer

All good.

I canceled the order

Carrier delivered to wrong address on the street. (Label clearly showed correct address, although a bit small). Luckily, homeowner where it was delivered was honest and brought it to me. Since the outside of the packaging identified what the item was so I was VERY lucky.

I'm happy!
