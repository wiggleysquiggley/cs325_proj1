Amazing! Works with all egg pasta dough, sourdough (just left dough in bowl and let the machine do all the folds and kneading) and will let me make batches big enough to fit the recipes tyipical to my house (usually 12-24 servings)

Not a blemish on it. Runs Fantastix, Came with a two year warranty. Best buy from kitchenaid! I love it..

This is my first KitchenAid mixer and I'm enjoying it. I make a lot of bread and it kneads wonderfully.

Arrived on time and in good condition. It works so far.

The mixer is in brand new condition. It was a great price for something that is normally quite expensive. The packaging was in the original box with full instructions. Great deal.

Just as described, came packed well in original box, used it to shred some zuchinni for bread and worked like a charm.

A1 eBay seller, Mixer looks brand new.Im happy wit this purchased, fast shipping.

For the 13 time now I‚Äôm always going to be in love with my KitchenAid stand mixers the obsession is real. I want a room full of them! I can‚Äôt get enough and of course it‚Äôs been tested. Refurbished or New KitchenAid is the best. Made in USA

Awesome mixer! Doesn't look like it was used. I would say someone bought it, and returned it after they were done.

Everything as described, can't even tell it its refurbished, looks brand new.

Perfect working, good as new and 2 year warranty!

Came as advertised, great condition very happy with it

Fast delivery, item in excellent shape

Great mixer.

Everything was packed just perfect. No blemishes...works fine so far. I really haven't had a chance to use it for cooking yet. I feel that I got a great deal. I asked questions before buying and I got quick and courteous answers.

Great product. Good seller

Mixer was well packed in what looked like original packaging. Arrived sooner than expected. Mixer is in excellent condition with all of the accessories. Works great. Great experience!

We haven't used it yet but pleased so far

Couldn't find a flaw on it.worrks great.

A very happy wife, can't wait for Christmas cookies. Thank you !!!!

Mixer works great!

Outstanding! Fast shipping and as described. I would definitely purchase from this seller again, but this item didn't work out for us. Great company though!!!

it holds all 6 qts like a pro

My order arrived 6 days early (3 days after order placed) with all the included accessories and the correct color. No dents, dings, scuffs or scratches. Plugged it in and it worked. Was a bit apprehensive when Kitchenaid stated it was shipped 2 days after ordering but clearly the tracking info wasn't updated in that time. I am happy with my purchase, as is my wife. And the price was good; $268 vs. $370+. And don't forget the warranty.

Looks great, works great!

Exactly as described‚Ä¶ steller eBayer! Thank you for listing the Kitchen Aid mixer‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs perfect!

Looks like new.

Great, everything as good as New

So far, its been fine. As described. Shipping took a several days but item was well packaged and arrived with no issues.

Received the mixer within a couple days. Everything was perfect and spotless. Even got a bread attachment that I previously didn‚Äôt have. Runs quiet and easy to use like my first one. Absolutely one of the Best Buys and prices around. Great Xmas gift. If you‚Äôre looking for a better deal, you won‚Äôt find it! Great ebayer!

Really great value, plus a 2 year warranty

Great item very pleased

Looks brand new

The knob that goes on the end of the handle used to raise and lower the bowl is missing. However, that is inconsequential. I bought it because my old one sounds like an outboard motor running out of the water. It was so noisy that I had to maximize the tv volume to hear the audio. The new on is so quiet that it is unheard just a few feet away. My wife loves the color [I didn't have a color choice when I bought the first one]. She is looking to do great things with it and I am very satisfied.

Love it looks and works brand new for less than half the price üëå

Excelente art√≠culo lo obtuve por casi 200 dolares menos que el mercado local y funciona a la perfecci√≥n, esta intacto sin rayones ni golpes

Great seller, quick shipping, item as described, thank you

Thank you for a pleasant transaction! The KitchenAid was exactly as described!

Only turned it on. Haven't tried it yet.

Love the mixer. Excellent condition. Fast shipping.

Item arrived just as described. Good seller. Will do business again.

Came to me as if it was new but without the bowl topper (not a problem for a refurbished price). It came without wear or tear and with the paddle, whisk, and dough attachments. Works very well, but it is a little hard taking off the bowl once it is attached to the lift mechanism. 9/10 from me

exactly as advertised. nice quality, fast shipping

Item just as described. In very good shape for the price. A few nicks on the base, but is expected for refurbished. Very fast shipping! Nice soft start feature! Comes with spiral dough hook, paddle beater and 6 wire whisk. Great mother's day gift!

I am very pleased with this Kitchen Aid. It looks like new. I could not pass up this mixer. The price and warranty are just unbeatable. Fast shipping and excellent packaging. Thank you!!!

Super fast shipping, beautiful Kitchenaid mixer. Can‚Äôt believe we got it so cheap. Awesome seller! A+

Easy transaction. Packaged great. Arrived quickly. Thank You!

great machine..

I made an order, paid, but it was sent only three days later. The quality is good, but the order arrived without a black handle. Very poor communication with the seller, I wrote that the order arrived but there was no handle. They answered me "that there is no guarantee for the handle", but what kind of guarantee can there be if they sent me the product without a part and I did not use it. I do not recommend buying KitchenAid products, the brand has deteriorated and the prices are not small.

Beautiful fast shipping super COMPANY AAAA ++++++Ôøº

AS DESCRIBED.NICE.

Arrived on time, sent correct finish. The beaters are kind of lacking in terms of apparent durability comparative to the beaters my mom's came with 2 years ago. Powers up, but initial start is sluggish. Hoping it holds up.

If you‚Äôre buying kitchen aid pro 600 refurbished. The pouring shield does NOT come with it, which the seller fails to write in the description. Everything else is included. Great product, price and a shipping otherwise!

Good saler , good service

This is exactly what I wanted. I‚Äôm going to try it out tomorrow

Good product!

Was delivered timely and works great! I wouldn't be able to tell it was not brand new, and it has helped to make some delicious loaves of bread and batches of cookies so far!

Like new, awesome mixer!

Good Seller. Item as described. AAA+++ Thank You!

Can't rate the item because I haven't received it. Kitchen Aid is having "shipping issues" and won't even provide an estimated date when it will arrive.

Great price on a fully functional product. They took a little while to ship it but, once things got rolling it went quickly. I would recommend buying from this seller.

Arrived quickly, in better than expected condition.

Awesome Seller. Shipped Fast. Good Product. Thank You

it just didn't fit my sink. If they had shown a picture of the bottom of the strainer, I would have known not to order it. My fault.

Awesome product

Was a great deal on a refurbished KitchenAide mixer with 2 year warranty

Very slow shipping, bad communication with this seller. The seller would dance around my questions like a politician. Have not tried out mixer yet. My mixer did not come with the rubber handle like I asked. The seller would not answer my question. The mixer just has a plain steel rod handle. Won't be buying from this ebay seller in the future.

Very worth the price lookin slik

Great item. Excellent condition! Fast shipping!

I have always wanted a kitchenaid mixer! Thank you for making this possible!!

Wonderful mixer

Nice appliance came at a fast time

Good deal Works perfect, looks perfect! Bought because it was made in usa. Dissppointed bowl isn't

Works well and the price was great

As a purchaser on EBAY for 20 years, this is my first negative review of a seller. I had ordered a silver mixer for $219 and immediately realized it was being shipped to the wrong address. Within minites I tried to cancel the item and was informed "It is too early to cancel, " and soon after, I was informed it was "too late to cancel." After many messages the order was canceled but the next day the price went up $40+ and the color was not available. Terrible experience and customer service!

Bought for my mom. She loves it. She said it works awesome and she can‚Äôt wait to use it more!!

Arrived in better condition than I expected for a refurbished item.

Looks perfect. Have not used it, but checked that it works and the motor sounds strong. All parts fit.

Exactly as listed and delivered on time.

Great mixer and great customer service

KitchenAid Pro 600 Series 6 Quart Bowl-Lift Stand Mixer, RKP26M1X (refurbished) arrived very quickly and in excellent condition. Thank you!

Fast Shipping and great service. Excellent seller.

Great product and warranty!

I‚Äôve used it once. So far, so good!

What I received and what was represented in the listing and photos are not the same. Customer service was dismissive. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll keep the mixer, or return, due to inaccurate and misleading description. The 1 star is the poor and rude response. I expect more from Kitchenaid. It‚Äôs not a buyer beware. Just a disappointed lifelong customer.

Lovely. Arrived quickly and works very well.

Did not know how heavy the the mixer was, but still love it.

Everything received exactly as described

Great price!!!! We where able to buy the model and the color mixer we wanted.

Beautiful NEW, PERFECT mixer! Shipped FAST! Perfect transaction! Thank you SO much!

This company lives up to it's expectations. I love the and most of all it arrived prior to the shipping date. I will use this company for all future endeavors.

Good price. Quality product

Great experience! Fast shipping and excellent quality.

Tried to contact seller about missing handle. Seller stated it was a cosmetic item and would not affect the use. However, I purchased for my elderly mother and her skin is very thin and the handle causes injuries. It is NOT just a cosmetic detail, it would help to prevent harm to her. Seller does not see it this way and told me to spend additional money to order a replacement part for that missing lift handle. The handle is all metal and thin with a sharp flat cut: end not rounded.

Not as described. Description says pristine like new condition. Dented scratches and not at all as described. I reached out because it was a gift and they seemed bothered. Offered to extend return window not helpful since it was a gift. They wouldn‚Äôt exchange. I hate they eBay allowed false advertising. They offered a bowl since that was dented however say it‚Äôs back orders and may be over a month. Very bad business.

The mixer is working as it should

The description of the mixer was exactly right. Very happy with the service. Ôøº

Great Deal, Smooth Transaction, Fast Delivery! Like NEW!

This was a great purchase. Buying refurbished is definitely the way to go! The mixer arrived fast and looks brand new!

Never received the item and response from the seller was generic!

This was a great deal and mixer is as good as new! However, the bowl lift black handle was missing. Seller explained that it was cosmetic and not covered under warranty? Does not make any sense when I could have just shipped the entire mixer back for free and had them send me a new one. The photos for the listing clearly show a black handle.

A+

Great Buy. Fantastic Mixer. Highly Recommend the seller and the mixer! We have made Fresh Bread and 2 Pumpkin Pies.

Great value on a factory-refurbished machine.

Came in great condition but was missing the grip handle

Awesome product...Fast shipping!

Love the product excellent thank you

Very nice. Work great. Quickly shipped. Great seller!

DO NOT BUY THIS! They do not back the quality of their product. Mine arrived malfunctioning & nobody will help me. They have given me the ‚Äúrun around‚Äù. Would NOT recommend buying refurbished, as it appears they don‚Äôt care what they sell you. The one that I received should never have been sold at all. It appears that now I am stuck with an expensive piece of junk that doesn't work correctly. Should have been sold as broken and not refurbished. Very disappointed.

Great product, fast shipping.

QUALITY ITEM!! Thank You.

fast shipping, item as described and works great. would buy from again

I love that I have option to buy certified refurbished KitchenAid products.

Great item

Sent the wrong color but she liked it so it was ok. I'd buy again

It did not arrive but was refunded

Great product at an incredible price!! Thanks KitchenAid!

Mixer arrived with only 3 of 4 feet on unit. Contacted seller. Said they would send one in 7 to 14 days. After 14 day no foot. Contacted seller said it was lost in transit. They would resend in 7 to 14 days. That's 28 total days to get a small rubber foot to make the mixer usable. That's pretty poor customer service

As advertised. quick shipping and arrived in good condition.

Arrived super fast! Thanks!!!

it arrived as almost New

as described!

Thank you!!!

It arrived on time and was a described by the seller . The seller was also helpful when I had to modify the timeline of the order and was eager to make the experience as pleasant as possible

Good deal, but annoyed by shipping instruction. Seller put an instruction for shipping company to not allow a vacation hold or pickup at Fedex location. Seemed unnecessary and caused headaches.

GREAT eBay seller!! ÔøΩÔøΩ AAA +++ description on money and perfect transaction! All Good

This item was selected for combined shipping with a food processor. The food processor arrived but the stand mixer in question never arrived. eBay thinks the order is complete and has requested this feedback. The tracking and shipping info says it arrived, but It did not arrive and I've had limited success communicating with KitchenAid. There has been no new shipping information related.

Thank You

Great seller, quick shipping and excellent communication! A+l

Seller will not ship nor communicate, had order for over 4 business days; zero faith in Kitchenaid now, lousy CS on KA Pro MagMixer discontinued right after purchase. Anemic motors; to date Asian commercial mixers have consistent bad reviews -- but they actually ship.

My mixer arrived missing parts. I contacted the seller (kitchen aid) and they refuse to send me the missing parts and blame me for purchasing a ‚Äúre-furbished‚Äù mixer. They say missing parts are cosmetic and not covered under their warranty. Description says in ‚Äúpristine like new condition‚Äù but if it‚Äôs missing parts when it arrives that‚Äôs on you! Terrible customer service.

Slow shipping, confusing warranty. The box clearly states only one year warranty and yet the listing states two years

This item is over 10 days late and no response as to what the problem is with the purchase

Aside from the difficult communication (slow to respond; not answering all the questions) and aside from shipping later than would be the norm (it shipped on the day that the auction estimated it would be received) I didn't receive the splash guard. That wouldn't have arisen as a question IF they had simply listed what was or wasn't included in the first place. Apologizing for a disappointment after the fact is ridiculous. There wouldn't be disappointment if I knew exactly what I was buying.

Remind me to leave feedback after I recieve the item. Until then there is not much I can say

Ya'll sure took my money fast but your dragging butt on shipping!!

Never shipped

Canceled order

they have not contacted me as of yet

You have any problems like a very loud friend noise right out of the box you didn‚Äôt t get help or assistance no customer service, suggestion, spend the extra $20 and go buy it at Costco, at least they will accept a return. Instead of just tell you. ‚Äú Thank you for contacting KitchenAid. We recommend contacting KitchenAid at the number listed on the Stand Mixer and in the use and care guide. They will ask you detailed questions and listen to the Stand Mixer. Thank you for visiting our store.‚Äô

Wanted the mixer. After a week of not being shipper, I Was trying to see what they delay was and my order was cancelled and refunded.

The seller cancelled the order. They said they had it priced wrong. I guess I wasn't the only one. Now have to wait 10 days to get my money back. That shows what kind of company KitchenAid/ Whirlpool is. That's probably why they have so many Refurbished

Two weeks late shipping and absolutely no communication. Very frustrating. Item as described when it finally arrived. I would leave no stars on seller communication but can't. Had to go to Ebay to get results.

Came with attachment logo off and it keeps falling off

Bought the item and was told a few days later that it was out of stock.

Inventory control is poor, zero communication. I was finally able to purchase a mixer after multiple failed attempts. Kept being told they were out of stock and having the sale cancelled a couple of days after ordering. Present for my wife is now late. Most who experienced this problem can't leave feedback after sale is canceled by seller. Why cancel the sale when inventory is replenished every couple of days?

It's like they're trying not to ship items. Ordered Nov 29th. Accepted projected delivery Dec 7-9. After 10 days nothing shipped. Kitchenaid should be a reputable company, but this experience is tarnishing it. Previous communication only resulted in a platitude response that they're trying. But they are not being successful.

where is my package, don't even have it yet and tracking says that it's delivered on Jan 7th, can you guys help me to find it or send me a new one for replacement, I didn't pay over 300 for nothing, I want my money back or send me another one, I DONT EVEN HAVE MY ORDER SINCE I ORDERED IT IN DECEMBER!!!

3rd time I've had a KitchenAid order canceled. Get it together!

It was as described. Shipping time was not as advertised but that was expected due to time of year.

Out of stock. I'm sad now :( But at least they canceled and communicated promptly so it's ok. I'm not mad about it. Better luck next time I guess.

Refused to honor price

Buenos d√≠as S√≠ para ver si me podr√≠an regresar el dinero porque mi producto no lleg√≥
