The mixer seems to be fine. But the box was all beat up and covered in gravel dust. The styrofoam that holding the mixer was busted. FedEx is a poor delivery service.

Quick ship, like new condition, thanks for a great experience.

I'm so happy to have a refurbished one - in red! - for a very reasonable price. It arrived earlier than the estimate by a few days.
Love this mixer I have been wanting one for a long time and my regret is I didn't get this sooner. I love using it and it has made baking so much easier!!!

Nice unit. Arrived in one week. Came in original box. Thanks.
Item as described, and works as expected. Quickly shipped and no issues. Would recommend.
Got to finally use our mixed yesterday and it worked beautifully
Like new exactly as described
Really easy to use and sturdy
Looks perfect! It was missing the scrapper whisk (#13) though. I'll need to order one from Amazon. Shipping took the full time allotted and arrived in a clean new Kitchenaid box with original instructions. I would definitely do business with them again despite the scraper whisk. For the huge savings in the mixer, buying the scraper whisk isn't a big deal.
As described! The mixer looks and works great! Thank you!
Since I love to bake this is a must have!
Beautiful, rapid shipment and delivery ahead of schedule
Is a gift.
Item as promised. Perfect condition and just like factory new. Good deal!
Arrived today. It is just the color I wanted! This seller was very professional and easy to work with. I can‚Äôt wait to start baking! I highly recommend this seller!
The mixer is beautiful! I fortunately we have not used it yet!
Have not used it yet, its a gift will update with more information
Quick, fairly priced and in condition described. Thanks!
Awesome mixer and at a good price. Great seller A+ Thank you Charlie
the fed ex driver left it out in the open in the middle of a thunderstorm, instead of putting under the porch roof not 4ft from where he actually left it. everything i received is soaking wet and im going to let it dry thoroughly before plugging it in and seeing if it‚Äôs damaged due to his negligence and laziness
Looks and functions as a bran new one.
Item received was as described and great price. Would purchase from this seller again.
Great product fast shipping A +++ seller Great price.

Gorgeous mixer, received on time in great condition. I am loving this product and would buy from this seller again.
Great value, great purchase. Love the mixer!
the item came to me very fast, I just had a hard time stopping the order because I found the item in a store and the color was not the same as the photo. KitchenAid is always fast and helpful with returns, I just felt it could have been cancelled and save time, if they were as fast with eBay sales as well.
It works
Looks like brand new packaging was perfect.
My wife is happy!That all i needüòÅFast delivery.

the item had a label created but still has not shipped. Delivery was supposed to be 30 jun, it is now july. They keep saying it has shipped when it has not.

Item was canceled and refunded for some reason
Very pleased!!!
The mixer survived FedEx. It must have had a harrowing experience. The box in which it arrived looked as though it had been beaten by a pack of loan sharks and dragged behind the truck. All the packing material inside was crushed with all the pieces were loose inside the box.
have not used it yet
Looks and runs like new

Took a while to get in. No response from seller as to when item would be shipped. Item works great. Theircustomers service needs works.
awesome!
All good.
I'm happy!
Carrier delivered to wrong address on the street. (Label clearly showed correct address, although a bit small). Luckily, homeowner where it was delivered was honest and brought it to me. Since the outside of the packaging identified what the item was so I was VERY lucky.
I canceled the order
