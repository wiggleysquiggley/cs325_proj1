I am satisfied with the product. What Iâ€™m not satisfied with is the Customer Service! There was a delay with the shipping and also thereâ€™s a delay when contacting customer service other than that the product is as advertised.

Ordered the KitchenAid mixer and I received two replacement water filters for a refrigerator. Called EBay Customer Service and they were not helpful at all. Finally called KitchenAid in Ohio and reached a great CSR. She was able to find my order and has shipped a new mixer to me as of 11/08/2024. Note: I was advised they didnâ€™t need the filters back and suggested that if I wanted to I could sell them. Guess Iâ€™ll put them on EBay!
I'm sure the mixer is fine, but it's been almost 3 weeks and I still haven't received it.
Took their sweet time shipping my item
We are missing the pouring shield.
