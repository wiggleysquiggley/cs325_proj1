Mixer arrived ahead of schedule, professionally packaged in a kitchen aid refurbished box. Bowl, paddles, and mixer look brand new and work upon testing. Very happy with my purchase.
Not a blemish on it. Runs Fantastix, Came with a two year warranty. Best buy from kitchenaid! I love it..
Amazing! Works with all egg pasta dough, sourdough (just left dough in bowl and let the machine do all the folds and kneading) and will let me make batches big enough to fit the recipes tyipical to my house (usually 12-24 servings)
This is my first KitchenAid mixer and I'm enjoying it. I make a lot of bread and it kneads wonderfully.
Just as described, came packed well in original box, used it to shred some zuchinni for bread and worked like a charm.
Arrived on time and in good condition. It works so far.
The mixer is in brand new condition. It was a great price for something that is normally quite expensive. The packaging was in the original box with full instructions. Great deal.
A1 eBay seller, Mixer looks brand new.Im happy wit this purchased, fast shipping.
It did not come with lifter handle in picture, and it's making a clunking/ loose gear sound. I am going to make bread with it this weekend and see if it works itself out, but I've used these before and I don't think I've heard one make this sound before.
Awesome mixer! Doesn't look like it was used. I would say someone bought it, and returned it after they were done.
Lovely refurbished Mixer! My granddaughter seems very pleased. I would rely on this Amazon refurbishing again. Packed well for transport.
Perfect working, good as new and 2 year warranty!
For the 13 time now I‚Äôm always going to be in love with my KitchenAid stand mixers the obsession is real. I want a room full of them! I can‚Äôt get enough and of course it‚Äôs been tested. Refurbished or New KitchenAid is the best. Made in USA
Fast delivery, item in excellent shape
Works great wife loves it
Everything as described, can't even tell it its refurbished, looks brand new.
Arrived on time and as described. Exactly as what you would expect... But packaging left something to be desired. Item still works though.

ABSOLUTE Garbage! The only thing refurbished was the box! They didn't even plug the mixer in no less refurbish it, Sounds like it's ready to Explode! All they do is put the broken mixer in a new box and sell it to the next Sucker!

Great product and arrived on time.
It looked brand new. Works awesome. Best price around
Worked great, item just as described, delivered on time thank you! aa++
Great mixer.
We haven't used it yet but pleased so far
My order arrived 6 days early (3 days after order placed) with all the included accessories and the correct color. No dents, dings, scuffs or scratches. Plugged it in and it worked. Was a bit apprehensive when Kitchenaid stated it was shipped 2 days after ordering but clearly the tracking info wasn't updated in that time. I am happy with my purchase, as is my wife. And the price was good; $268 vs. $370+. And don't forget the warranty.
nice mixer. quick and professional handling
Works great! Ezpz seller, very fast delivery. Thanks!
Looks brand new! Everything about this mixer, the stand, motor and attachments look brand new! Very pleased with my purchase. Definitely recommend this seller! Super fast FedEx shipping! Arrived from order to delivery in 5 days!
A+ Bowl was Crooked. But they returned it nicely
Outstanding! Fast shipping and as described. I would definitely purchase from this seller again, but this item didn't work out for us. Great company though!!!
Great product. Good seller
Everything was packed just perfect. No blemishes...works fine so far. I really haven't had a chance to use it for cooking yet. I feel that I got a great deal. I asked questions before buying and I got quick and courteous answers.
Recieved product earlier than. I thought, in perfect condition all attachments accounted for, I couldnt be happier
A very happy wife, can't wait for Christmas cookies. Thank you !!!!
Couldn't find a flaw on it.worrks great.
Mixer was well packed in what looked like original packaging. Arrived sooner than expected. Mixer is in excellent condition with all of the accessories. Works great. Great experience!
Received the mixer within a couple days. Everything was perfect and spotless. Even got a bread attachment that I previously didn‚Äôt have. Runs quiet and easy to use like my first one. Absolutely one of the Best Buys and prices around. Great Xmas gift. If you‚Äôre looking for a better deal, you won‚Äôt find it! Great ebayer!
Great, everything as good as New
Really great value, plus a 2 year warranty
description was spot on great buy
Mixer works great!
So far, its been fine. As described. Shipping took a several days but item was well packaged and arrived with no issues.
it holds all 6 qts like a pro
The knob that goes on the end of the handle used to raise and lower the bowl is missing. However, that is inconsequential. I bought it because my old one sounds like an outboard motor running out of the water. It was so noisy that I had to maximize the tv volume to hear the audio. The new on is so quiet that it is unheard just a few feet away. My wife loves the color [I didn't have a color choice when I bought the first one]. She is looking to do great things with it and I am very satisfied.
Exactly as described‚Ä¶ steller eBayer! Thank you for listing the Kitchen Aid mixer‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs perfect!
Looks great, works great!
Great seller, quick shipping, item as described, thank you
Item just as described. In very good shape for the price. A few nicks on the base, but is expected for refurbished. Very fast shipping! Nice soft start feature! Comes with spiral dough hook, paddle beater and 6 wire whisk. Great mother's day gift!
Excelente art√≠culo lo obtuve por casi 200 dolares menos que el mercado local y funciona a la perfecci√≥n, esta intacto sin rayones ni golpes

Great seller, excellent value, quick shipping
Great item very pleased
just like said it was great seller
Item arrived just as described. Good seller. Will do business again.
Thank you for a pleasant transaction! The KitchenAid was exactly as described!
Came to me as if it was new but without the bowl topper (not a problem for a refurbished price). It came without wear or tear and with the paddle, whisk, and dough attachments. Works very well, but it is a little hard taking off the bowl once it is attached to the lift mechanism. 9/10 from me
Looks brand new
As described, super fast shipping. A+
I am very pleased with this Kitchen Aid. It looks like new. I could not pass up this mixer. The price and warranty are just unbeatable. Fast shipping and excellent packaging. Thank you!!!

I made an order, paid, but it was sent only three days later. The quality is good, but the order arrived without a black handle. Very poor communication with the seller, I wrote that the order arrived but there was no handle. They answered me "that there is no guarantee for the handle", but what kind of guarantee can there be if they sent me the product without a part and I did not use it. I do not recommend buying KitchenAid products, the brand has deteriorated and the prices are not small.
Thank you for your expeditious service!

If you‚Äôre buying kitchen aid pro 600 refurbished. The pouring shield does NOT come with it, which the seller fails to write in the description. Everything else is included. Great product, price and a shipping otherwise!
Arrived on time, sent correct finish. The beaters are kind of lacking in terms of apparent durability comparative to the beaters my mom's came with 2 years ago. Powers up, but initial start is sluggish. Hoping it holds up.
great deal
Perfect
Wonderful purchase and seller!

Item better than described. Wife loves it!
Great deal fantastic product
Very slow shipping, bad communication with this seller. The seller would dance around my questions like a politician. Have not tried out mixer yet. My mixer did not come with the rubber handle like I asked. The seller would not answer my question. The mixer just has a plain steel rod handle. Won't be buying from this ebay seller in the future.
Shipped quick and looks brand new.
Great item. Excellent condition! Fast shipping!
I love it! So worth the price. I am so happy I chose it!
Great!!
The Kitchen Aid mixer looks like new and works perfectly
Fast shipping! Thank you very much!
Awesome product
Was a great deal on a refurbished KitchenAide mixer with 2 year warranty
As a purchaser on EBAY for 20 years, this is my first negative review of a seller. I had ordered a silver mixer for $219 and immediately realized it was being shipped to the wrong address. Within minites I tried to cancel the item and was informed "It is too early to cancel, " and soon after, I was informed it was "too late to cancel." After many messages the order was canceled but the next day the price went up $40+ and the color was not available. Terrible experience and customer service!
Very worth the price lookin slik
Looks brand new, functions great. A++Seller!
Thank you. It‚Äôs exactly what I needed. I have used it twice now in less that 24 hours
Awesome mixer. It says refurbished, but looked new. Love it!
Good deal Works perfect, looks perfect! Bought because it was made in usa. Dissppointed bowl isn't
I have always wanted a kitchenaid mixer! Thank you for making this possible!!
Wonderful mixer
Looks perfect. Have not used it, but checked that it works and the motor sounds strong. All parts fit.
Bought for my mom. She loves it. She said it works awesome and she can‚Äôt wait to use it more!!
a dream come true, in my country Brazil, this product costs the equivalent of $8,000, impossible to buy. In the USA, with work and dedication anything is possible. Very happy with the product. God save America ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ
Great shipping. Already installed and works excellent!!! Awesome product and great shipping
Excellent Seller and Products!!!!!!!!
Fast shipping. Excellent communication in regards to item. Thank you
Looks brand new, haven't used it yet but I expect it to run like brand new as well and at 50% of the price of a brand new unit

Awesome product at a great price. Delivered quick and as described.
Did not know how heavy the the mixer was, but still love it.
What I received and what was represented in the listing and photos are not the same. Customer service was dismissive. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll keep the mixer, or return, due to inaccurate and misleading description. The 1 star is the poor and rude response. I expect more from Kitchenaid. It‚Äôs not a buyer beware. Just a disappointed lifelong customer.
Good experience. Product as expected.
Amazing product arrived earlier than what I expected!
Super fast shipping!! Great seller communication!! A++++

Very nice-I've used several times and this mixer operates exactly as expected.
Appreciate it. Works great
Good quality ÔøΩÔøΩ
Tried to contact seller about missing handle. Seller stated it was a cosmetic item and would not affect the use. However, I purchased for my elderly mother and her skin is very thin and the handle causes injuries. It is NOT just a cosmetic detail, it would help to prevent harm to her. Seller does not see it this way and told me to spend additional money to order a replacement part for that missing lift handle. The handle is all metal and thin with a sharp flat cut: end not rounded.
Mixer was in perfect condition but wish it was in original box since it was a gift.
Beautiful item and it looks even better in person!I got this item for such a good deal, much appreciated!!
S√∫per stoked! Amazing product and a great deal
Exactly as described. Arrived very quickly

Great Deal, Smooth Transaction, Fast Delivery! Like NEW!
Not as described. Description says pristine like new condition. Dented scratches and not at all as described. I reached out because it was a gift and they seemed bothered. Offered to extend return window not helpful since it was a gift. They wouldn‚Äôt exchange. I hate they eBay allowed false advertising. They offered a bowl since that was dented however say it‚Äôs back orders and may be over a month. Very bad business.
Nice product, fast shipping. Great Ebayer!
Good as describes. Good service!
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è was missing handle end but contacted kitchen aid and was told that‚Äôs cosmetic so found one online to replace it. Other than that awesome mixer!

great Ebayer
Me llego en excelente condici√≥n y funciona a la perfecci√≥n.
Works as expected
This was a great deal and mixer is as good as new! However, the bowl lift black handle was missing. Seller explained that it was cosmetic and not covered under warranty? Does not make any sense when I could have just shipped the entire mixer back for free and had them send me a new one. The photos for the listing clearly show a black handle.
This was a great purchase. Buying refurbished is definitely the way to go! The mixer arrived fast and looks brand new!
The mixer is loud but it works so I believe we are still good
Product as described, in perfect conditions. Recommended!

DO NOT BUY THIS! They do not back the quality of their product. Mine arrived malfunctioning & nobody will help me. They have given me the ‚Äúrun around‚Äù. Would NOT recommend buying refurbished, as it appears they don‚Äôt care what they sell you. The one that I received should never have been sold at all. It appears that now I am stuck with an expensive piece of junk that doesn't work correctly. Should have been sold as broken and not refurbished. Very disappointed.
QUALITY ITEM!! Thank You.
Bought two in one day. Arrived in perfect condition with all the parts, Ebay warranty a plus. Expect this mixer to last for at least 20 years. Just like the last one.
Exactly as described and item works great! Good packaging as well. 5/5 Thanks!
excellent product. Fast shipping

My only concern was the shipping. I was worried bc I didn't have a tracking number til yesterday the 15th. I ordered it the 10th. But it came with free shipping and got here 2 days early! So I'm a happy camper!! And it's BEAUTIFUL!
I Just Got It, But It Looks Like A Brand New Machine. Thank You.

Great product and speedy delivery.
It did not arrive but was refunded
great product, as described.
Thank you for the timely delivery. It was exactly what I wanted.
Great product fast delivery
Mixer arrived with only 3 of 4 feet on unit. Contacted seller. Said they would send one in 7 to 14 days. After 14 day no foot. Contacted seller said it was lost in transit. They would resend in 7 to 14 days. That's 28 total days to get a small rubber foot to make the mixer usable. That's pretty poor customer service
I really hadn't used, but all seems well.
Great item. Just as described
It's better to buy refurbished than used. I bought one used and it lasted a year. Refurbished is like new
Great ebayer!!!!! Amazing product. Great communication

This item was selected for combined shipping with a food processor. The food processor arrived but the stand mixer in question never arrived. eBay thinks the order is complete and has requested this feedback. The tracking and shipping info says it arrived, but It did not arrive and I've had limited success communicating with KitchenAid. There has been no new shipping information related.Follow-up from: r***3The shipping info has been transmitted and everything to do with my order is sorted to my great satisfaction. I am pleased to do business here. Thank you.
Item shipped quickly and is just as described. I am very please with my purchase. Great E-Bay seller.
Excellent
Seller will not ship nor communicate, had order for over 4 business days; zero faith in Kitchenaid now, lousy CS on KA Pro MagMixer discontinued right after purchase. Anemic motors; to date Asian commercial mixers have consistent bad reviews -- but they actually ship.
Perfect. Great packaging.. fast shipping

great mixer
My mixer arrived missing parts. I contacted the seller (kitchen aid) and they refuse to send me the missing parts and blame me for purchasing a ‚Äúre-furbished‚Äù mixer. They say missing parts are cosmetic and not covered under their warranty. Description says in ‚Äúpristine like new condition‚Äù but if it‚Äôs missing parts when it arrives that‚Äôs on you! Terrible customer service.

Very nice
Slow shipping, confusing warranty. The box clearly states only one year warranty and yet the listing states two years
This item is over 10 days late and no response as to what the problem is with the purchase
Aside from the difficult communication (slow to respond; not answering all the questions) and aside from shipping later than would be the norm (it shipped on the day that the auction estimated it would be received) I didn't receive the splash guard. That wouldn't have arisen as a question IF they had simply listed what was or wasn't included in the first place. Apologizing for a disappointment after the fact is ridiculous. There wouldn't be disappointment if I knew exactly what I was buying.
Remind me to leave feedback after I recieve the item. Until then there is not much I can say
You have any problems like a very loud friend noise right out of the box you didn‚Äôt t get help or assistance no customer service, suggestion, spend the extra $20 and go buy it at Costco, at least they will accept a return. Instead of just tell you. ‚Äú Thank you for contacting KitchenAid. We recommend contacting KitchenAid at the number listed on the Stand Mixer and in the use and care guide. They will ask you detailed questions and listen to the Stand Mixer. Thank you for visiting our store.‚Äô
Ya'll sure took my money fast but your dragging butt on shipping!!
Never shipped
The seller cancelled the order. They said they had it priced wrong. I guess I wasn't the only one. Now have to wait 10 days to get my money back. That shows what kind of company KitchenAid/ Whirlpool is. That's probably why they have so many Refurbished
Canceled order
Came with attachment logo off and it keeps falling off
they have not contacted me as of yet
Two weeks late shipping and absolutely no communication. Very frustrating. Item as described when it finally arrived. I would leave no stars on seller communication but can't. Had to go to Ebay to get results.
Wanted the mixer. After a week of not being shipper, I Was trying to see what they delay was and my order was cancelled and refunded.
Bought the item and was told a few days later that it was out of stock.
It's like they're trying not to ship items. Ordered Nov 29th. Accepted projected delivery Dec 7-9. After 10 days nothing shipped. Kitchenaid should be a reputable company, but this experience is tarnishing it. Previous communication only resulted in a platitude response that they're trying. But they are not being successful.
Inventory control is poor, zero communication. I was finally able to purchase a mixer after multiple failed attempts. Kept being told they were out of stock and having the sale cancelled a couple of days after ordering. Present for my wife is now late. Most who experienced this problem can't leave feedback after sale is canceled by seller. Why cancel the sale when inventory is replenished every couple of days?
where is my package, don't even have it yet and tracking says that it's delivered on Jan 7th, can you guys help me to find it or send me a new one for replacement, I didn't pay over 300 for nothing, I want my money back or send me another one, I DONT EVEN HAVE MY ORDER SINCE I ORDERED IT IN DECEMBER!!!
3rd time I've had a KitchenAid order canceled. Get it together!
It was as described. Shipping time was not as advertised but that was expected due to time of year.
Out of stock. I'm sad now :( But at least they canceled and communicated promptly so it's ok. I'm not mad about it. Better luck next time I guess.
Refused to honor price
Buenos d√≠as S√≠ para ver si me podr√≠an regresar el dinero porque mi producto no lleg√≥
